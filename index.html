            We interviewed 5 artists between the ages of 25-65 for 20-30 minutes. 
            We organized all of our interview notes into wants, needs, likes to create an empathy map. 
            Our empathy map allowed us to have a better picture into what to consider when designing Creaven. 
            Our researched revealed most of our interviewees had to often adapt their idea due to budget or being unable to find the supply they originally wanted.  A few artists also had experience in trading services for supplies or using found art to complete their project. A interesting find was that many artists didn’t want to receive donated supplies due to lack of quality and options. 
            A common desire throughout all interviews was: they were all willing to give back to fellow artists.

            Creaven was designed to provide access to guidance, supplies, and a creative haven

            relationships within the art community, artists are sometimes unable to have the means to create their original concepts which causes resources to go unused and artists lose their original inspiration.
